## Project Overview


### Overview

- **Name:** NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works
- **Brief Description:** The Vault protocol is the first single-token lossless yield protocol launched by Defibox. Users can earn corresponding token income by depositing tokens. The assets can be flexibly deposited and withdrawn with open and transparent on chain data. Vault income mainly comes from Defibox protocol income, Yield+ rewards, BP income, REX income, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the utility, the protocol will issue a standard EOS token called sToken, which represents a deposit certificate. sToken can be used in multiple DeFi protocols to obtain more benefits.
- **简介：** EOS上的传统绘画艺术作品的NFT标准，是基于EOS卓越的NFT性能，及艺术作品的巨大市场潜力，开发一个适用于传统绘画艺术作品特征的专属NFT标准，以更好的展示其原创属性、收藏价值，并保护艺术家和收藏者的艺术版权。
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** a public use that provides a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields. Code will be open source for contribution to EOSIO repository.
- **与EOSIO的关系：** 一种公共设施，为艺术家在EOS上以NFT的形式发布他们的传统绘画艺术作品提供一个合适的专属标准。为EOS用户和项目团队提供保护其传统绘画艺术作品生成的NFT的所有权和价值的参考依据。
- **Reason for Interest:** It provides a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields. It will brings TVL and income to Defibox team while giving benefits to participants. Ecosystem Boost: attract inactive EOS tokens which will prosper ecosystem
- **有意义的原因：** 它可以吸引更多艺术家、EOS用户及项目团队参与传统绘画艺术作品NFT的创作、收藏和二次开发。它可以提升ShuFan NFT在EOS社区NFT领域的声誉，并增加我们发布的传统绘画艺术作品NFT作品的知名度和销售量。生态系统提升：增加EOS生态NFT的活跃度和用户量，并让EOS服务更多的线下艺术家。


### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):



- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components

- Data models of the core functionality

- API specifications of the core functionality

- An overview of the technology stack to be used

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious



### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- 应用我们的标准（项目），在EOS上发布他们的传统绘画艺术品NFT，可以更好的保护艺术家及NFT收藏者的权益。我们的标准可以更好的区分物理载体艺术品与NFT复制品的权属关系，一方面，艺术家在EOS发布他们的作品后，不再担心原创手稿的处理可能影响NFT的价值；另一方面，收藏者也不再担心收藏NFT后，原创手稿可能通过其它形式生成新的NFT再次销售等权属问题。清晰的权属关系，可以同时让艺术家更有在EOS发布作品，及让收藏者在EOS上收藏作品更有保障感。最终让EOS上的艺术品NFT更加丰富、活跃。

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- -1）绘画艺术家；2）EOS 用户，包括任何NFT收藏者用户和团队

- What need(s) does your project meet?
- -有物理载体（例如水彩纸、油画纸等）的统绘画艺术作品在转换成NFT后的总是面临权属问题，限制了这类NFT在EOS上的发展。我们的项目可以解决这个问题，吸引更多艺术家和NFT收藏者进入EOS生态，促进传统绘画艺术品NFT在EOS更快速的发展。

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
- -无，
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  - 尚未研究其它区块链系统是否有类似的项目。

## Development Status



> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- 我们在2022年7月14日在medium上已经发布[第一个版本（V1.0）](https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b#4965)的标准
- 基于此标准，在Atomichub上发布了一个Schema，https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/shufan.free/traditional
- 基于此Schema，已经发布了4件纸质绘画作品
- 并将其中的2件免费发放给EOS用户，以推广此标准并吸引更多EOS上的NFT玩家

- 这个项目目前依然还在早期的阶段，但在Pomelo上已经获得的贡献超过80个，代表了来自EOS社区的热情和支持。这个项目有可能为EOS引来更多的艺术家，并促进艺术品NFT在EOS上出现爆发式增长。所以，我们希望进一步优化这项标准的细则，并以一种更规范的方式展示这个标准，吸引更多艺术家和NFT爱好者的关注。

## Development Roadmap



This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.



Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.



For each milestone,



- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.

- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.

- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.

- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).



> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

从Pomelo等其它渠道获得更多支持资金，进一步支持标准的完善/推广/增加用户量


**附加信息**

此标准可以理解为应用在EOS上的无代码前端，后期可以拓展后端。
