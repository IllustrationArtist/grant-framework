## Project Overview


### Overview

- **Name:** NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works
- **Brief Description:** The Vault protocol is the first single-token lossless yield protocol launched by Defibox. Users can earn corresponding token income by depositing tokens. The assets can be flexibly deposited and withdrawn with open and transparent on chain data. Vault income mainly comes from Defibox protocol income, Yield+ rewards, BP income, REX income, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the utility, the protocol will issue a standard EOS token called sToken, which represents a deposit certificate. sToken can be used in multiple DeFi protocols to obtain more benefits.
- **简介：** EOS上的传统绘画艺术作品的NFT标准，是基于EOS卓越的NFT性能，及艺术作品的巨大市场潜力，开发一个适用于传统绘画艺术作品特征的专属NFT标准，以更好的展示其原创属性、收藏价值，并保护艺术家和收藏者的艺术版权。以下简称 NS-TPA。
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** a public use that provides a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields. Code will be open source for contribution to EOSIO repository.
- **与EOSIO的关系：** 一种公共设施，为艺术家在EOS上以NFT的形式发布他们的传统绘画艺术作品提供一个合适的专属标准。为EOS用户和项目团队提供保护其传统绘画艺术作品生成的NFT的所有权和价值的参考依据。
- **Reason for Interest:** It provides a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields. It will brings TVL and income to Defibox team while giving benefits to participants. Ecosystem Boost: attract inactive EOS tokens which will prosper ecosystem
- **有意义的原因：** 它可以吸引更多艺术家、EOS用户及项目团队参与传统绘画艺术作品NFT的创作、收藏和二次开发。它可以提升ShuFan NFT在EOS社区NFT领域的声誉，并增加我们发布的传统绘画艺术作品NFT作品的知名度和销售量。生态系统提升：增加EOS生态NFT的活跃度和用户量，并让EOS服务更多的线下艺术家。


### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

此标准旨在为传统绘画艺术家的作品转化为NFT提供一个标准化的解决方案，解决绘画作品的原始手稿（Original manuscript of the painting. Hereinafter referred to as the manuscript）在转换为NFT后面临的版权归属上的挑战。

核心内容：
1.一段精简的纸质声明，用于表明手稿执行了NS-TPA。我们也将草拟一份模板用于参照执行。
2.贴在作品背后并艺术家签字+盖骑缝章
3.上传生成Templete，并声明第一件作品与原稿相关（有些平台没有template，不一定是第一个mint）
4.邮寄问题及记录
对此要拟定完整的细节，确保权益，减少争议。

宣传推广：
宣传推广，让更多NFT收藏者了解，让艺术家了解并上传他们的作品
需要不断的优化细节，实时反馈修改，

每位艺术家都能比较容易的做到
这套标准有简单易操作，经得起验证，无需第三方认证的特征，就更容易达成共识。


### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- 应用我们的标准（项目），在EOS上发布他们的传统绘画艺术品NFT，可以更好的保护艺术家及NFT收藏者的权益。我们的标准可以更好的区分物理载体艺术品与NFT复制品的权属关系，一方面，艺术家在EOS发布他们的作品后，不再担心原创手稿的处理可能影响NFT的价值；另一方面，收藏者也不再担心收藏NFT后，原创手稿可能通过其它形式生成新的NFT再次销售等权属问题。清晰的权属关系，可以同时让艺术家更有在EOS发布作品，及让收藏者在EOS上收藏作品更有保障感。最终让EOS上的艺术品NFT更加丰富、活跃。
- Just as we analyzed in [our project on Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart). According to the masterworks report. In 2020, the global painting transaction value has exceeded 50 billion US dollars, the transaction volume has exceeded 30 million. And [the estimated value of the online art market worldwide in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/284586/global-online-art-market-sales-2013/) is $13.59 Billion. The market potential is really huge!
- With the empowerment of NFT, the market potential of traditional paintings and artworks will be further stimulated.
- EOS如果能抢先占领这个市场，将给EOS的生态发展和市场价值的极大改变。而这套标准将加速实现这一点，为传统绘画作品与NFT之间建立一道可靠的桥梁。

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- -1）绘画艺术家；2）EOS 用户，包括任何NFT收藏者用户和团队

- What need(s) does your project meet?
- -有物理载体（例如水彩纸、油画纸等）的统绘画艺术作品在转换成NFT后的总是面临权属问题，限制了这类NFT在EOS上的发展。我们的项目可以解决这个问题，吸引更多艺术家和NFT收藏者进入EOS生态，促进传统绘画艺术品NFT在EOS更快速的发展。

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
- -无，
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  - 尚未发现其它区块链系统有类似的项目。



## Team

### Team members

### Legal Structure

- **Registered Legal Entity:** N/A

- **Registered Address:** N/A



### Team Experience （Done）

- ShuFan NFT is a professional team that creates and operates drawing NFTs. As the core creator of the team, ShuFan has more than 10 years of experience in painting creation and is a senior painting creation artist. The team has been operating the painting NFT project on EOS for more than 18 months, released more than 140 original works, and generated more than 2,000 NFTs.
- The team has applied for a Pomelo grant for this project, named [NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works](https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart). And published [the 1.0 version of this standard](https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b) on our Medium in Jul 14, 2022. In order to implement this standard, we [created a Schema and released 4 paintings](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/shufan.free/traditional) on AtomicHub。But we think the 1.0 version of this standard needs to be improved.
- We have always been the leading team of painting NFT on EOS, and have explored many functions on EOS, like Whitelist Drop ([Sample](https://eos.atomichub.io/drops/217)) and other functions. Keeping a close cooperative relationship with well-known teams on EOS such as EOS Nation and EOS support, having our own [Web](https://shufannft.carrd.co/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT), [telegram](https://t.me/ShuFanNFT) and other medias. We also applied for a Pomelo grant for another project, named “[ShuFan NFT Art](https://pomelo.io/grants/shufannft)”，aimed to promote the advantages of NFTs on EOS via painting NFT.

## Development Status


我们更早期经历了更多的探索，最终结合EOS上NFT的功能特征，探索出一个简单易操作的标准。
> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- 我们在2022年7月14日在medium上已经发布[第一个版本（V1.0）](https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b#4965)的标准
- 基于此标准，在Atomichub上发布了一个Schema，https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/shufan.free/traditional
- 基于此Schema，已经发布了4件纸质绘画作品
- 并将其中的2件免费发放给EOS用户，以推广此标准并吸引更多EOS上的NFT玩家

- 这个项目目前依然还在早期的阶段，但在Pomelo上已经获得的贡献超过80个，代表了来自EOS社区的热情和支持。这个项目有可能为EOS引来更多的艺术家，并促进艺术品NFT在EOS上出现爆发式增长。所以，我们希望进一步优化这项标准的细则，并以一种更规范的方式展示这个标准，吸引更多艺术家和NFT爱好者的关注。

## Development Roadmap



This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.



Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.



For each milestone,



- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.

- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.

- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.

- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).



> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
