## Project Overview
### Overview
- **Name:** NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (Hereinafter referred to as NS-TPA)
- **Brief Description:** A set of exclusive NFT standards that combine the NFT functions on EOS blockchain, and apply to the characteristics of traditional painting artworks (Hereinafter referred to as TPA), protect the artistic copyrights of TPA original manuscript and corresponding NFTs. Help to bring the huge NFT market potential of TPA into the EOS ecosystem.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** This set of standards combines the NFT function on the EOS blockchain. It is a public good on EOS that can provide important industry standards for EOS users and project teams to protect the ownership and value of NFT of their TPA on EOS. This set of standards is also conducive to demonstrating the excellent performance of NFT on the EOS blockchain.
- **Reason for Interest:** We are the pioneers of converting TPA to NFTs on EOS. Establishing this set of standards can 1) solve the copyright problems encountered by the TPA NFT we released on EOS; 2) enhance the reputation of ShuFan NFT in the EOS community, and increase the influence of our works; 3) attract more offline artists, EOS users and project teams to participate in the creation and collection of TPA NFT, and increase the art NFT activity on EOS.

### Project Details
This standard aims to provide a standardized solution when the TPA by traditional painting artists is converted into NFT on EOS, and solve the copyright ownership problems of the original manuscript after conversion to NFT.

- **The core content of the standard**:
  - A condensed paper statement indicating that the manuscript implements NS-TPA.
  - The statement is pasted on the back of the work, and signed by the artist + stamped with a cross-page seal.
  - When uploading and generating NFT Templete, add an electronic statement, indicating that this NFT has implemented NS-TPA, and Mint #1 is bound to the original manuscript.
  - The NFT Template is signed by the artist's EOS account.

- **Standard Features**: 
  - **Easy to learn**. The steps to complete this standard are simple, and each artist only needs to learn and operate easily. 
  - **Easy to identify**. This set of standards is template-based, easy to identify, and easy to reach consensus on.
  - **Self-certification**. It's based on the self-certification of the artist. No third-party agency support is required, which reduces the trouble caused by third-party certification.
  - **Can not be tampered with**. Artist's handwritten signature + EOS blockchain wallet signature, both have irreversible characteristics, are safe and can withstand the verification of time.

**Promotion of Standard：**
  - Promoting this standard within and outside the EOS community is also an important part of this project. The more artists and EOS users understand and use this set of standards, the stronger the consensus will be, and the more details of the feedback to optimize standards. We will adopt multiple ways to promote this set of standards, such as establishing a website, NFT gifts, and Twitter promotion.

### Ecosystem Fit
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

   Just as we analyzed in [our project on Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart). According to the masterworks report. In 2020, the global painting transaction value has exceeded 50 billion US dollars, the transaction volume has exceeded 30 million. And [the estimated value of the online art market worldwide in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/284586/global-online-art-market-sales-2013/) is $13.59 Billion. The market potential is really huge! The excellent performance of NFT on the EOS blockchain is second to none in the industry. Successfully occupying this market first will greatly change the ecological development and market value of EOS.

- Who is your target audience?

  Painting artists; EOS users, including NFT collector users and teams.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

  Traditional paintings with physical carriers (such as watercolor paper, oil painting paper, etc.) always face ownership issues after being converted into NFTs, which limits the development of such NFTs on EOS. Our project can solve this problem and better protect the rights and interests of artists and NFT collectors on EOS.
  
  Our standard can better distinguish the ownership relationship between the physical carrier artwork and the NFT replica. On the one hand, after artists release their works on EOS, they no longer worry that the processing of the original manuscript may affect the value of the NFT. On the other hand, collectors no longer worry about ownership issues such as original manuscripts may generate new NFTs in other forms after collecting NFTs. A clear ownership relationship can simultaneously allow artists to publish their works on EOS and collectors to have a sense of security when collecting works on EOS. In the end, the artwork NFT on EOS will be richer and more active. This set of standards will establish a reliable bridge between traditional paintings and NFTs, and may accelerate the transfer of TPA to the NFT market on EOS.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? 

  There are no viable open source projects meeting this need.
  
## Team
### Team members
- **Team Leader:** ShuFan
- Jack

### Legal Structure
- **Registered Legal Entity:** N/A
- **Registered Address:** N/A

### Team Experience （Done）
- ShuFan NFT is a professional team that creates and operates drawing NFTs. As the core creator of the team, ShuFan has more than 10 years of experience in painting creation and is a senior painting creation artist. The team has been operating the painting NFT project on EOS for more than 18 months, released more than 140 original works, and generated more than 2,000 NFTs.
- The team has applied for a Pomelo grant for this project, named [NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works](https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart). And published [the 1.0 version of this standard](https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b) on our Medium in Jul 14, 2022. In order to implement this standard, we [created a Schema and released 4 paintings](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/shufan.free/traditional) on AtomicHub。But we think the 1.0 version of this standard needs to be improved.
- We have always been the leading team of painting NFT on EOS, and have explored many functions on EOS, like Whitelist Drop ([Sample](https://eos.atomichub.io/drops/217)) and other functions. Keeping a close cooperative relationship with well-known teams on EOS such as EOS Nation and EOS support, having our own [Web](https://shufannft.carrd.co/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT), [telegram](https://t.me/ShuFanNFT) and other medias. We also applied for a Pomelo grant for another project, named “[ShuFan NFT Art](https://pomelo.io/grants/shufannft)”，aimed to promote the advantages of NFTs on EOS via painting NFT.

## Development Status
这是一个比较新的领域，我们早期经过艰苦的摸索，曾发布了一个简易版的标准，习惯称之为 V1.0。

- 我们在2022年7月14日在medium上已经发布[第一个版本（V1.0）](https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b#4965)的标准
- 基于此标准，在Atomichub上发布了一个Schema，https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/shufan.free/traditional
- 基于此Schema，已经发布了4件纸质绘画作品
- 并将其中的2件免费发放给EOS用户，以推广此标准并吸引更多EOS上的NFT玩家

这个版本的标准目前依然相对简单且不是很完整，但在Pomelo上已经获得的贡献超过80个，代表了来自EOS社区的热情和支持。我们相信这套标准如果能得到进一步的优化和推广，获得更广泛的采纳和共识，必然会吸引更多艺术家和NFT爱好者的关注EOS。

我们团队自身也在发布传统绘画艺术品，我们将用好这套标准，经历通过参加EOS社区活动、与其它团队合作等方式推广、改进这套标准。未来如果在资金和技术上获得足够的支持，我们计划将1）此标准扩展到其它实物艺术品；2）跟EOS上的NFT平台合作，更好的嵌入此标准加入一些衍生功能；3）跟博物馆、艺术馆等合作，开启传统绘画艺术品NFT的新路径。


## Additional Information
**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**: EOS Network Foundation Twitter.

- Work you have already done. 
  我们对比了很多NFT平台，发现EOS是最适合艺术品NFT的区块链，类似WAX因为游戏类NFT而闻名于世，但我们认为游戏主导的环境并不是很适合艺术类NFT的发展，这点比不上EOS。关于这套标准我们在发布V1.0前，经历了2个多月的研究、讨论和探索，尝试过的很多方法在易用性、可操作性等方面都容易各方面的限制，多次的失败让我们选择了这样一个简单易用、适用于EOS区块链的标准。
